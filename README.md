# Test Driven Development in Ionic: An Introduction to TDD in Typescript applications using Jest
## Purpose
Use this application to jumpstart your TDD in Typescript. Its goal is to illustrate how to add support for unit tests to an Ionic project with minimal
configuration.

## Contributing
Open an issue first to discuss potential changes/additions. If you have questions with the guide, feel free to leave them as issues in the repository. If you find a typo, create a pull request. The idea is to keep the content up to date and use github’s native feature to help tell the story with issues and PR’s, which are all searchable via google. Why? Because odds are if you have a question, someone else does too! You can learn more here at about how to contribute.
